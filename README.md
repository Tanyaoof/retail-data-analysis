# ðŸ§± Green vs Traditional Building Materials: A Comparative Cost-Sustainability Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project evaluates the trade-offs between **green building materials** (AAC blocks, fly ash bricks, etc.) and **traditional materials** (red bricks, concrete blocks) used in residential construction. The aim is to determine:

- Whether green alternatives are economically viable,
- How they perform in terms of strength, thermal efficiency, and environmental impact, and
- Which material offers the best balance of **cost**, **performance**, and **sustainability**.

The project uses **data analysis, decision modeling, and visual reporting** to help civil engineers, architects, and policymakers make informed material choices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

> *Is it worth switching to green building materials for residential construction? A comparative cost-sustainability analysis versus conventional materials.*

We compare materials across multiple dimensions including:
- Initial and life cycle cost
- Thermal insulation capacity
- Structural strength
- Embodied carbon
- Water usage
- Fire resistance
- Construction efficiency
